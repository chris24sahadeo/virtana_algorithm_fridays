# Maximizing distance between primes

Given a positive even number a, determine the two prime numbers p1 and p2 such that a = p1 + p2 while maximizing the distance between p1 and p2. 
If two the primes p1 and p2 don't exist, state so.

Input Specification:  
Single number a, 6 <= a <= 1e6  

Output Format:  
a1: p1, p2  
a2: No p1 and p2   

Once you can get it for 1 number, do it for N numbers.  

Input format:  
N  
a1  
a2  
a3
